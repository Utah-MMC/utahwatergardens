// Add these routes to your App.js Routes section:

{/* Service Area Routes - Auto-generated */}
{/* Note: These routes should be added before the catch-all route */}

{/* Example routes - you'll need to add all city routes */}
{/* <Route path="/{city-slug}" element={<{ComponentName} />} /> */}

// To add all routes automatically, you can use a script to generate them
// from the cityData.js file using getAllCitySlugs() function.

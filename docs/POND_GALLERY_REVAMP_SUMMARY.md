# Pond Gallery Page Revamp Summary

## Overview
The Pond Gallery page has been completely revamped to match the established blue theme and improve consistency across the website.

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Theme Inconsistency ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The page was using green colors (`#10b981`, `#059669`) that didn't match the site's established blue theme.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced all green colors with the proper blue theme colors:
  - `#10b981` → `#1e40af` (primary blue)
  - `#059669` → `#3b82f6` (secondary blue)
- Updated gradient backgrounds to use consistent blue theme
- Maintained visual hierarchy while ensuring theme consistency

### 2. Custom Hero Implementation ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: The page was using a custom hero section instead of the standard PageHero component.

**Solution**:
- Replaced custom hero implementation with the standard `PageHero` component
- Removed 100+ lines of custom hero CSS
- Ensured consistency with other pages across the site
- Maintained all functionality including stats display

### 3. Code Duplication ✅ FIXED

**Solution**:
